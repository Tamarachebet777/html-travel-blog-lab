    <p> Walking on the paths of the park felt peaceful as I reconnected with nature.
        The view of the animals just existing and the acacia trees was spectacular. 
        I was among the lucky ones to get a glimpse of black rhinoceros , leopards 
        and African wild dog as they are endangered species hence rarely found. 
        The whole experience was one-of-a-kind and thrilling.
